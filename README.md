# Modern C++ Notes

A collection of carefully documented notes on various attributes of modern C++. 

This list includes categories such as:
- Smart Pointers
- Move Semantics
- Template Metaprogramming (type traits, SFINAE)
- Concurrency Organization and Synchronization
- Functional Paradigms (e.g. lambdas, functional templates)
- Memory Management, e.g. memory pools, rvalues/lvalues, RAII

Overall, am following [this](https://federico-busato.github.io/Modern-CPP-Programming/) amazing FREE guide.

At the same time, I'll add detailed code annotations explaining the expected output, especially the reasons behind the observed behavior.
